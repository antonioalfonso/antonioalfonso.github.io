<ol>
<li>The rest of the states and territories that did not have any cases now report their first ones during this month.</li>
<li>New York becomes the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. reporting both the most cases and deaths to date.</li>
<li>As of March 31, the CDC reported there were 5,325 deaths, 215,391 confirmed cases, and more than one million tests completed in the U.S.</li>
<li>Several experts estimated that between 500,000 and ""millions"" of tests per day were necessary.</li>
<li>There are many challenges to ramping up capacity: ""Complaints vary, but labs say they don't have enough swabs, test kits, reagents, personal protective equipment (PPE), staff, or machines to run the specific tests required.""</li>
